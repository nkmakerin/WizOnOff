# WizOnOff
Objective of  Designing WizOnOff Project is to develop Wiznet WIZFI360-PA module based Standalone IoT platform to explore various use case of WIZFI360-PA without use of any extra micro controller. 

Features of project :

Fully standalone IoT development platform with only WIZFI360-PA module as main controller for WiFi and User application.

Fully Programmable with custom firmware developed using W600 SDK or Arduino IDE with W600 package.

Onboard 4 Relay for automation, Port for DS18B20 Temperature Sensor

External header for extend GPIO/UART1/I2C to interface various Sensors/actuators.

Onboard HiLink AC-DC module as utility power supply (110V-230V AC) to 5V 3 AMP DC converter.
